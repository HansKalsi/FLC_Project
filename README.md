# Fuzzy Logic Controller Project
This is a FLC project built in Unity for a University assignment.
This repo contains the custom code used, but exludes the other Unity assests such as Materials, Prefabs, Scenes, and Settings to make it clearer.

# What Is Its Purpose
This FLC controls a grass cutter robot, encouraging it to cut as much grass as possible whilst avoiding obstacles in the environment

# How It Works
The project is built in such a way that the grass, robot, and obstacles can be spawned in, which was supposed to help drive a playground interface in a web browser, but the project did not get to that stage. So instead it spwans in a singular predictable fashion, but this can always be edited manually in [code](./Assets/Scripts/World%20Setup.cs)
